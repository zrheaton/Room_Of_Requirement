3. Data Structures: Dictionaries
Dictionaries in Python are incredibly versatile and are used to map keys to values. They are fundamental in many algorithms and data processing tasks.

Key Concepts:
Creating and Accessing Dictionaries: How to create a dictionary, add items, access values, and check if a key exists.
Dictionary Methods: Methods like .keys(), .values(), and .items() for accessing dictionary elements.
Iterating Over Dictionaries: Using loops to go through keys, values, or key-value pairs in a dictionary.
Exercises:
Dictionary Basics:
Create a dictionary representing a person (with keys like 'name', 'age', 'city') and print out its values.
Word Count Using Dictionary:
Given a list of words (like the one from your word frequency script), count how many times each word appears using a dictionary.
Nested Dictionaries:
Create a nested dictionary (a dictionary where some values are dictionaries themselves) and access various elements in it.
These exercises will help solidify your understanding of string manipulation and dictionaries. Feel free to share your code or ask questions if you encounter any difficulties. Happy coding!
