# Room_Of_Requirement
#This is a directory that I keep for two primary reasons. 
#One, it's helpful for my life and organizing various projects I am working on. 
#Two, it's a great place for potential employers to look over my work and see what I can contiribute. 
#Please note, some of this work is made by myself, some with AI assistance, some in collaboration with friends. It really all depends on what I'm trying to accomplish. 
#Due credit anyone and anything I collaborate with. It's all about making the world better, one "bit" at a time (pun intended).
